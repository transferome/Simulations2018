"""Uses multinomial sampling to sample haplotypes given the starting frequencies
estimated from harp.  This samples 2000 haplotypes, which is thus equivalent
to 1000 diploid individuals.  For each subregion, it creates a specified number of
  multinomial draws, into a sample file.  The currently value of 20 for example.
  Creates a file of 20 lines in length for each subregion, with a different multinomial
  draw from the starting estimate frequencies.  The 20 value can be altered as desired
  at this point, it is arbitrary"""
